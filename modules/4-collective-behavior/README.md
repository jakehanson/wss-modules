# How Can the Environment Dictate a Collective Decision?
In this simulation, we will examine how the environment dictates nest site selection in Temnothorax ant colonies. Experiments have shown that these ants choose to immigrate to a new nest if and only if the potential nest reaches a critical density or "quorum". Using a stripped down model of individual ant behavior, this simulator shows how the same individual level behavior in different environments leads to different outcomes depending on whether or not a nest site can build up to quorum. Furthermore, each set of model parameters is ideally suited to reach quorum in a specific nest geometry, thereby providing a means in which evolution can tune individual behavior to select the correct nest as a colony.
